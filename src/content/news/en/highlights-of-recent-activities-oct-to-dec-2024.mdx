## The gist

- Built a soundproof vocal booth in my room
- Built my first split keyboard from a build kit
- Bought my first 3D printer

## My soundproof vocal booth

I built a soundproof vocal booth in my room. It cost less than 20,000 yen and took me one week and a half.

Combined with soundproofing added to the door, on average, it turned out to have an approximate 12 to 14dB soundproof effect. (7dB or so alone)

## My first split keyboard "The Endpoint"

I built a split keyboard called "The Endpoint" from the build kit. It cost around 40,000 yen and took me a week or so.

Although it's definitely not affordable compared to those off-the-shelf keyboards, you'd be able to learn a lot from building a keyboard on your own.

## My first 3D printer "Bambu Lab A1 mini"

I bought my first 3D printer, "Bambu Lab A1 mini". I was in luck and able to get it on sale at less than 30,000 yen.
Up until now, I've created things like:

- The trackball cover for "The Endpoint"
- A J-shaped hook for cable arrangement
- A compartment tray for the desk drawer

All of these are, however, designed by someone else. While it's a plus for me that I'm only one button away from creating someone else's work, I envision designing things on my own down the road. To that end, I keep making progress day by day──  to become "the creator" who has control of from upstream to downstream: design to creation.
