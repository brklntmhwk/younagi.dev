Since Feb 22, 2024, I set about to develop my own website, and finished it up to a minimum decent level after 4 months or so. If you're interested in the details of the development, see [this article](https://younagi.dev/blog/astro-website).

## What did I create my own website for?

There are several reasons for that:

- I wanted to offer what I learn or experience to the general public but am already tired of SNS
- I wanted to have my own platform and use it as my portfolio too
- I wanted to get hands-on experience in developing a static website
