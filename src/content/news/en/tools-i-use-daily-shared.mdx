## The gist

My list of tools (Hardware & software) has just been shared. I'm not really sure if anyone else wants to see it, but you can check it in the page below.

It includes the following categories:

- **Daily use:** Main & peripheral devices, etc.
- **Arts:** Music, photo & videography, etc.
- **Development:** Tech stack and my coding environment

Note that this might change down the road.
