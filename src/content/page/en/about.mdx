## Intro

Here, I offer what I've learnt or experienced in daily lives by posting blog articles or bulletins.

## My stance on this website

- Information equality
  - Whoever is a reader of this website can access all the information I offer
    - No such content as paid member only articles
- Student-and-student relationships rather than teacher-and-student ones
  - Not only do I offer what I've already learnt or experienced, but also ongoing things I've been trying to do
- offering information in multiple languages
  - To broaden the scope of readers and as a way of learning languages by myself
  - I hardly ever rely on machine translation and translate articles manually in most cases
    - With things like linguistic or cultural differences of each language considered, contents are sometimes translated freely or even rewritten with different expressions

## Principles for what I offer

When it comes to what I offer, I roughly stick to the following principles:

- **Stick to novelty and originality**
  - The more original, the more intriguing
- **Write only about what I love to write**
  - As long as I want to write it, the genre could be anything
- **Strike a happy medium (especially when mentioning social beliefs, ideas, and so on)**
  - I'm not here to prove my social beliefs to be right against someone else
- **Avoid using intense words or addressing sensitive topics**
  - I'm not here to hurt someone else
  - Having said that, I might hurt someone unconsciously because of the potential gaps in what we think as intense or sensitive
- **No advertising**
  - this website contains **NO affiliate links**
  - When I'm reading a web article, I often feel distracted by and a bit disappointed at those ads saying hello to me in between the contents (The better the quality of the contents, the more disappointed I am...)
  - A small amount of advertising incomes \<\<\< Readers' better experience
