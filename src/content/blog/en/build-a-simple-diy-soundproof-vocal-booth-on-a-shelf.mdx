description: Want to build a DIY soundproof room but no enough space? What about that of a vocal booth? Here are the build process and its soundproofing effect measured.
---

## Intro

I've always envisioned having my own soundproof room someday but it's been ages ever since then. The space limitation had long been standing in my way.

That said, nothing could beat my fiery motivation. After countless attempts to find closure, I came to one conclusion: A vocal booth on a shelf.

### Reader personas

- Want to have a soundproof room but the space limitation thwarts it
- Thinking about building a soundproof vocal booth
- Want to know whether it's worth a shot to build a soundproof vocal booth

### My proficiency level

As of the day I'm writing this article, my proficiency level in this field is as follows:

- Have built something of a small wooden desk and shelf several times
- Have no experience in working on such a large DIY project as this

## Main

First, here's the final product. It took me a week and a half to complete the project from planning and designing to building the booth.
It cost ðŸ”´ðŸ”´yen in total. (Only the materials included)

The concepts are:

- As cheap as possible
- Short build time
- Easy to dismantle and tweak later

Whereas it's nowhere near as good as those soundproof rooms posted by profesional DIYers on YouTube, it seems good enough in terms of cost-performance, time-effectiveness, and effortlessness.

### Plan and design

I went through this phase perfunctorily because I wanted to embark on building as soon as possible.
First, I made a nominal design on iPad that is merely a drawing and then fixed the measurements of the booth. Second, the meterial of the walls and how to arrange them are finalized. [^1]

[^1]: I've also learnt "What's soundproof?" simultaneously.

The material ended up being OSB(Oriented Strand Board), not the popular plasterboard. How come? In Japan, they must be disposed of as industrial waste and it takes a fairly amount of effort.

### Procure tools and materials

Most of them were available at EC stores. Other than that, I went to a DIY store nearby to buy some lumber and other stuff.

All materials eventually used are as follows:

- OSB board 1820 x 910 x 11 (mm)
- Pegboard 600 x 450 and 600 x 300 (mm)
- Wooden board for work desk 710 x 590 (mm)
- Sound blocking sheet
- Acoustic panels
- Connecting brackets Ã—4
- L-shaped corner brackets Ã—4
- Flat-head screws 2.7mm x 10mm & 3.8mm x 13mm
- Tension rod
- Book stand Ã—2
- Cafe curtain
- Gap sealing tape
- Hooks Ã—2

Tools I used are:

- Drill driver
  - Used to make pilot holes and drill screws
- Staple gun
  - Used to attach the sound blocking sheet
- Step ladder
  - Used to handle the top board
- Convex
  - Used to measure longer distances
- Square
  - Used to build the booth at right angles
- Craft knife
  - Used to cut the sound blocing sheet
- Cutting mat
  - Used with the craft knife
- Double-sided tape
  - Used to attach the acoustic panels

I enjoyed the lumber cutting service from the DIY store. Thanks to that, I was able to cut corners in the most laborious task, which I'm very happy about and thankful for. [^2]

[^2]: It was 7-times straight-line cuts and took only shorter than half an hour. Unless you're a considerably skilled DIYer, you should enjoy the service.
