## Intro

Here, I offer what I've learnt or experienced in daily lives by posting blog articles or bulletins.

## My stance on this website

- Information equality
- Student-and-student rather than teacher-and-student relationship
- offering information in multiple languages

## Principles for what I offer

When it comes to what I offer, I roughly stick to the following principles:

- **Stick to novelty and originality**
  - The more original, the more intriguing
- **Write only about what I love to write**
  - As long as I want to write it, the genre could be anything
- **Strike a happy medium (especially when mentioning social beliefs, ideas, and so on)**
  - I'm not here to prove my social beliefs to be right against someone else
- **Avoid using intense words or addressing sensitive topics**
  - I'm not here to hurt someone else
  - Having said that, I might hurt someone unconsciously because of the potential gaps in what we think as intense or sensitive
- **No advertising**
  - this website contains **NO affiliate links**
  - As a reader, I often feel distracted and am fed up with ads inserted in between contents in blog articles

The second and fourth points might go against the basics of SEO and impressions respectively, but I'd rather stick to my principles. that said, of course I won't give up seeking for more readers at the same time.
