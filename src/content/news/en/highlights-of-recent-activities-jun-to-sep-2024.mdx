Since this August, I started planning to build my homebuilt PC from scratch. As a total newbie, I finally managed to get it done after a lot of twists and turns. It took me almost a month from planning to the OS installation.

1. **Select parts:** 1 week
2. **Procure parts:** 3~4 days
3. **Build the PC:** 2 days
4. **Fix errors:** 2 weeks
5. **install the OS:** 1 day

I bought a Mac Studio M2 MAX. When it comes to the Studio Display, I'm going to buy if the price goes down to ~~a decent~~ an affordable level, maybe.

For the time being, I'm going to use the M2 Mac Studio for creative work and the homebuilt PC for coding respectively.
