description: Cards always enthrall us just being there; we are hardwired to pay more attention to them than plain text. However, Markdown doesn't support it syntaxically. Why not create a plugin then?
---

## Intro

Ever since childhood, I had dreamed of becoming a wizard——

The dream's come true this time.
But the ability is very limited; you cannot turn apples into apple pies, or someone you hate into Gudetama either. Instead, you can transform Markdown into whatever you want is HTML.

By the way, [Unified](https://unifiedjs.com/), a huge ecosystem of document conversion as best represented by Remark and Rehype, has many volunteers scattered around the world who are developing and maintaining a lot of the plugins.
However, none of them says, "You can summon card components on the field in Markdown with me", as far as I can see. [^1]

[^1]: There are a lot of plugins for "Linkcard" instead.

Why not create it on your own then?—— Now that I feel like I can even fly.

### Reader personas

- Want to create a Remark plugin on their own
- Interested in `remark-card`
- Working hard on embellishing their Markdown/MDX blog

### My proficiency level

As of the day I'm writing this article, my proficiency level in this field is as follows:

- Have a three-year experience as a software engineer in total (Not in a row)
- Understand the basics of JavaScript and TypeScript(I hope so)
- Have never published an NPM package before

## Main

Here's the Github repository.

https://github.com/brklntmhwk/remark-card

### How to use

`remark-card` offers two Markdown dialects: `card-grid` and `card`.
The former plays a role as a wrapper for multiple cards and the latter is self-explanatory.

> Hereafter, some HTML code in examples will be omitted for brevity if it's not relevant to the main theme here. (e.g., `class`)

#### card

The card is written in Markdown like:

```markdown title="Markdown"
:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev
:::
```

This turns into...

```html title="HTML"
<div>
  <div class="image-container">
    <figure>
      <picture>
        <source srcset="...">
        <source srcset="...">
        <img src="..." alt="younagi.dev">
      </picture>
      <figcaption>younagi.dev</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <div class="content-container">
    younagi.dev
  </div>
</div>
```

And the final output is:

:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev
:::

#### card-grid

Next up, let's line up some cards in the card grid component.

```markdown title="Markdown"
::::card-grid
:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev Part 1
:::
:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev Part 2
:::
:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev Part 3
:::
::::
```

This turns into:

```html title="HTML"
<div>
  <div>
    <div class="image-container">
      <figure>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="...">
          <source srcset="...">
          <img src="..." alt="younagi.dev Part 1">
        </picture>
        <figcaption>younagi.dev Part 1</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
      younagi.dev Part 1
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="image-container">
      <figure>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="...">
          <source srcset="...">
          <img src="..." alt="younagi.dev Part 2">
        </picture>
        <figcaption>younagi.dev Part 2</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
      younagi.dev Part 2
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div class="image-container">
      <figure>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="...">
          <source srcset="...">
          <img src="..." alt="younagi.dev Part 3">
        </picture>
        <figcaption>younagi.dev Part 3</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
      younagi.dev Part 3
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And the final output is:

::::card-grid
:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev Part 1
:::
:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev Part 2
:::
:::card
![younagi.dev](../../../assets/images/younagidev.jpg)
younagi.dev Part 3
:::
::::

#### Use it in Astro

Incidentally, the card components are already all over there in this website.

https://younagi.dev/work/

To use Remark/Rehype plugins in Astro, you need to do something in the Astro config file at the root like this:

```ts title="astro.config.ts" {2,10-19}
import { defineConfig /* ... */ } from "astro/config";
import remarkCard, { type Config as RemarkCardConfig } from 'remark-card';
// ...

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  markdown: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      // ...
      [
        remarkCard,
        {
          customHTMLTags: {
            enabled: true,
          },
          cardGridClass: 'card-grid',
          cardClass: 'card',
        } satisfies RemarkCardConfig,
      ],
      // ...
    ],
    // ...
  }
  // ...
});
```

This is actually enough to make it work, but it requires a bit more steps if you use Astro components to customize the HTML tags and styles.

In my case, twe Astro components are used: `Card.astro` and `CardGrid.astro`. The resultant `card` and `card-grid` tags generated by `remark-card` will in turn be transformed into them respectively.
For more details, see the source code below.

https://github.com/brklntmhwk/younagi.dev/tree/main/src/components/elements/Card

Following [the MDX's manners](https://docs.astro.build/ja/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#custom-components-with-imported-mdx), pass them onto the `<Content />` tag as custom components and the deal is all done. Below is an example of it:

```ts title="~/lib/mdx-components.ts"
import { Card, CardGrid } from '@/components/elements/Card';
// ...

export const mdxComponents = {
  // ...
  card: Card,
  'card-grid': CardGrid,
  // ...
};
```

```astro title="~/pages/blog/[slug].astro"
---
import BlogLayout from '@/layouts/BlogLayout.astro';
import { mdxComponents } from '@/lib/mdx-components';
import type { GetStaticPaths } from 'astro';
// ...

export const getStaticPaths = (async () => {
  // ...
}) satisfies GetStaticPaths;

const { entry } = Astro.props;
const { Content, headings } = await entry.render();
---

<BlogLayout entry={{ ...entry }} {headings}>
  <Content components={mdxComponents} />
</BlogLayout>
```

### Post-development notes

It doesn't look different from README up until this point, so let me seriously think back on the dev experience here.

- Language: ~~JavaScript~~ TypeScript
  - I can't help shaking like a leaf without type safety
  - ~~CommonJS~~ Following the ESM's manners
- Markdown syntax: [Generic directives/plugins syntax](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/generic-directives-plugins-syntax/444)
  - I made up such a dialect that anyone familiar with it will get taken aback at, and was going to adopt it at first, but ended up transitioning to the more general-looking syntax
  - e.g., `:::`, `::::`, etc.
- Test runner & Package manager: [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
  - It's a versatile meat bun being a JavaScript runtime, test runner, and package manager simultaneously
  - Test-wise, it's compatible with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/ja/) and thus familiar to me and easy to migrate
  - Its novelty and high performance were the determining factors

I consumed the code written by forerunners as if bathing and most of it turned out to be written in the JavaScript and JSDoc combi.
It's agreeable if writing code for a product by and large [^2], but this time I went with TypeScript since it's such a small project and I'm more familiar with it.

[^2]: Not writing in TypeScript saves you the time for transpiling while ensuring you type safety with JSDoc.
Plus, JSDoc helps you make decs in its manners, which make it easier to communicate with readers on the purposes of the code.

## Outro

Actually, I've developed and released another Remark plugin called `remark-video` soon after the `remark-card`.

https://github.com/brklntmhwk/remark-video

I was planning to make a new article about it at first, but gave up in the end.
After all, it didn't take me as much time and energy as the `remark-card` and therefore there's not much to share in particular. On top of that, this article sort of made me feel a tinge of contentment somehow. [^3]

[^3]: Frankly speaking, I just found it tedious.
