## The gist

My list of tools (Hardware & software) has just been shared. Take a look at [the page](https://younagi.dev/tools/) if you're interested in it. It includes the following categories:

- **Daily use:** Main & peripheral devices, etc.
- **Arts:** Music, photo & videography, etc.
- **Development:** Tech stack and my coding environment

Note that this might change later.
