### Astro

### Front Matter CMS

Along with a choice of framework, what takes you ages to decide is that of CMS(Content Management System). I fell in love with Front Matter CMS.

### Cloudflare Pages

## Afterword

I spent a tremendous amount of time reading articles about how to create my personal website, watching a bunch of tutorials for various JS frameworks on YouTube, and actually getting to work on it. As a novice, it felt as if I were stargazing when I was looking for a constellation of frameworks.

Among them, I bumped into outstanding and brilliant one above all: Next.js, a framework for React. Since then, I started creating my personal website, simultaneously learning it. After 8 months or so, I successfully built a decent Next.js website.

However, long story short, we broke up finally. How come? It is fascinating in providing a full range of features, handling the backend stuff on behalf of me, and so on, but therein lies the rub; as it upgrades and becomes equipped with a lot more features, it seems to be deviating from the JS standard. Plus, I've found it hard to catch up with those continuously upcoming features. (I barely stuck at it until the App Router...)

In the end, I encountered with Astro, a framework for JS frameworks, if you like. What I love most about it is its flexibility; it keeps its functionality to a bare minimum and leaves enough room for your customization. In my case, I avoid using such JS frameworks as React where possible and stick to using vanilla JS(More precisely, TypeScript).
