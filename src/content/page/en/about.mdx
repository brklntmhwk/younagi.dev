## About my website

What have I built this website for? I'm at a loss for the answer but it's at least not for such a wonderful purpose as aspiration for world peace. Neither is it for conveying my voice to the public. It might boil down to "Hitori sumo". That said, it'd be nice if anyone else enjoys what I do in the end.

### My stance on this website

- Information equality
  - Everyone can access all the information I offer
    - No paid member only content
- Student-and-student relationships rather than teacher-and-student ones
  - Not only do I offer what I've already learnt or experienced, but also ongoing things I've been trying to do
- offering information in multiple languages
  - To broaden the scope of readers and as a way of learning languages by myself
  - I hardly ever rely on machine translation and translate articles manually in most cases
    - Bear in mind that free translation (nominally called "translation") is included to a certain extent

### Principles for what I offer

When it comes to what I offer, I roughly stick to the following principles:

- **Stick to novelty and originality**
  - Styles unique to reading materials
  - Novel approaches to writing topics
- **Write only about what I love to write**
  - As long as I want to write it, the genre could be anything
- **Strike a happy medium (especially when mentioning social beliefs, ideas, and so on)**
  - I'm not here to prove my social beliefs to be right against someone else
- **Avoid using intense words or addressing sensitive topics**
  - I'm not here to hurt someone else
  - Having said that, I might hurt someone unconsciously because of the potential gaps in what we regard as intense or sensitive
- **No advertising**
  - this website contains **NO affiliate links** (I just wanted to say that)

### The easy-to-hard level in some articles

---
<StarRating method="rating" value={3} leftEnd="Easy" rightEnd="Hard" />

Articles categorized as "[Learning](https://younagi.dev/blog/categories/learning/)" have a "Level" field indicated as five stars. Bear in mind that this is totally based on my subjective judgment considering the criteria below.

- Time required
  - How long and how much trouble it takes for me to get it done
- Complexity
  - How complex it is to understand
- Level of abstraction
  - The more abstract, the more difficult

You might want to consider my proficiency level as of the moment I'm writing the article, which is also specified in the article.
